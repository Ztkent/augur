## What is a 'System Prompt'
A system prompt helps guide the direction and quality of responses generated by a GPT model. It serves as the initial context or instruction provided to the model. It influences the models understanding of the task at hand. A well-crafted prompt can lead to more relevant and coherent responses, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Why Augur?
Augur is capable of generating well-structured system prompts from a simple app idea. This allows developers to experiment with different inputs, adjust their model's behavior, and iterate on the development of applications that use natural language generation. 

## How Does It Work?
When a system prompt is requested, Augur performs the following:
- Evaluates the user's input and identifies the key themes and topics.
- Generates each section of the system prompt simultaneously, reducing computation time.
- Each section is reviewed to ensure it aligns with the desired structure and content.
- Presents the output to the user. Provides the option to download the prompt in Markdown format.
- For each section, the user is given the option to regenerate the response, allowing for quick iteration.
