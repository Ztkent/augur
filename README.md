## What is a 'System Prompt'
A system prompt is crucial in guiding the direction and quality of responses generated by a GPT model. It serves as the initial context or instruction provided to the model, influencing its understanding of the task or conversation at hand. A well-crafted prompt can lead to more relevant and coherent responses, enhancing the overall user experience and ensuring the model generates output aligned with the user's intentions.

## Why Augur?
Augur is capable of generating well-structured and pre-aligned system prompts from a simple conversation. This allows developers to quickly try different inputs, adjust their model's behavior, and iterate on the development of applications that use natural language generation. 

## How Does It Work?

When a system prompt is requested, Augur performs the following steps:

1. Evaluate the user's input and identifies the key themes and topics.
2. Generate each section of the system prompt simultaneously, reducing computation time.
3. Each response is reviewed and validated to ensure it aligns with the desired structure and content.
4. Merge each section to a final document, which is then evaluated by the LLM
5. Present the output to the user. 
6. Provide the options to copy or download the new system prompt in Markdown format.
