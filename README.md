# Augur
An assistant to rapidly align new GPT projects. 

## What is a 'System Prompt'
A system prompt is crucial in guiding the direction and quality of responses generated by a GPT model. It serves as the initial context or instruction provided to the model, influencing its understanding of the task or conversation at hand. A well-crafted prompt can lead to more relevant and coherent responses, enhancing the overall user experience and ensuring the model generates outputs aligned with the user's intentions.

## Why Augur?
Augur is capable of generating well-structured and pre-aligned system prompts from a simple conversation. This allows developers to quickly try different inputs, adjust their model's behavior, and iterate on the development of applications that use natural language generation. 

## How does it work?
When a system prompt is requested, Augur will:  

- Generate a given section of the instructions. Responses are reviewed, and validated to ensure that they match the desired structure and content.  
- Augur will then generate the next section of the prompt, and the process will continue until the entire system prompt is generated.  
- In the end, a full output is produced and scored by the LLM. This is provided to the user.  
- The user can provide feedback. This feedback is fed into the loop and it is repeated.  
- Users can target a specific section of the prompt to regenerate if the other parts are satisfactory.
